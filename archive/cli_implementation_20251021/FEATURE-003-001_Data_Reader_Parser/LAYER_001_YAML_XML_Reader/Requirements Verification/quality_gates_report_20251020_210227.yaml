  recommendation: NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
  timestamp: '20251020_210227'
recommendations:
  continue:
  - Maintain high test coverage on new features
  - Keep test pyramid ratio balanced
  - Continue TDD practices for all new code
  improve:
  - Add more edge case tests as system evolves
  - Consider mutation testing for test quality
  - Monitor test execution time as suite grows
  next_steps:
  - Deploy to staging environment
  - Run integration tests with dependent systems
  - Conduct security and performance testing
