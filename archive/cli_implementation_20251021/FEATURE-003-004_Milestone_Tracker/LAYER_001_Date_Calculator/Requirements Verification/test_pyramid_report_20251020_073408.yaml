recommendations:
  current_status: Excellent test pyramid structure
  strengths:
  - Good ratio of unit to integration tests
  - High code coverage achieved
  - Fast test execution
  - No flaky tests detected
  improvements:
  - Continue maintaining high unit test coverage
  - Add more edge case tests as features evolve
  - Consider property-based testing for complex logic
  next_steps:
  - Monitor coverage on new code additions
  - Keep test execution time under 1 second
  - Add integration tests for cross-component features
