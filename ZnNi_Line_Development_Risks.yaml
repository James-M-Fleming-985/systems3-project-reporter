    title: NADCAP Audit Preparation Delay Risk
    description: >
      The SF team being so busy with many other tasks from wider stakeholders,
      there may be delays in completing the NADCAP action plan and SF documentation review,
      meaning we may not be ready for the NADCAP Audit and the pre-audit planned for March 26, 2025.
    likelihood: high
    impact: high
    mitigations: >
      Prioritize NADCAP tasks; assign dedicated resources; weekly progress reviews;
      escalate to management if delays occur

    title: SF QMS Documentation Hierarchy Accuracy
    description: >
      If we do not fully understand the documentation hierarchy, the overarching document
      (SF QMS) could have inaccuracies which defeats the objective of being able to signpost
      anyone unfamiliar with the documentation in SF.
    likelihood: medium
    impact: high
    mitigations: >
      Conduct documentation hierarchy workshop; peer review of QMS structure;
      validate with SF stakeholders; create visual documentation map
