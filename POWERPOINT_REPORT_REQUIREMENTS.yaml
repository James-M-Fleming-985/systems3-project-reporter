design_principles:
  primary_goal: "Replicate what we see in the app on the specific pages"
  key_requirements:
    - "Roadmap = Horizontal Gantt chart (NOT cards)"
    - "Milestones = 3-column time-based view (Last/This/Next Month)"
    - "Risks = Card-based grouped by severity (MISSING - needs implementation)"
    - "Changes = Table with old→new date visualization"
    - "All content must remain editable (native PowerPoint objects)"
  
  formatting:
    - "Use app's exact color scheme"
    - "Match app's layout structure precisely"
    - "Include same information fields as app displays"
    - "Maintain visual hierarchy from app"
    - "Use icons where app uses them (✓ ○ 👤 📅 📍 🔜)"

technical_constraints:
  - "Must use python-pptx library"
  - "All elements must be editable (tables, text boxes, shapes)"
  - "Handle None/null values gracefully"
  - "Prevent file corruption"
  - "Generate valid PPTX files"

current_issues_identified:
  roadmap:
    issue: "Currently showing blank/empty instead of Gantt bars"
    fix_needed: "Draw horizontal bars for each project with completion %"
  milestones:
    issue: "Using 2-column card layout instead of 3-column time-based"
    fix_needed: "Change to Last Month | This Month | Next Month columns"
  risks:
    issue: "Slide is completely missing"
    fix_needed: "Implement risks slide with severity-grouped cards"
  changes:
    issue: "Current table doesn't match app's clean format"
    fix_needed: "Use exact app table format with better old→new visualization"

success_criteria:
  - "Roadmap shows horizontal Gantt bars for all projects"
  - "Milestones organized in 3 time-based columns"
  - "Risks slide exists and shows severity-grouped cards"
  - "Changes table has clean format with red strikethrough → green bold dates"
  - "All slides look like polished screenshots of the app"
  - "Professional presentation quality"
  - "Content is editable in PowerPoint"
  - "No file corruption errors"
