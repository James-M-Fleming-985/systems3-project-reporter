# Systems³ Project Reporter - Smart Parser Summary

## How It Works Now

### ✅ Flexible Milestone Detection
The parser now intelligently detects milestones using standard MS Project conventions:

**Milestone Detection Rules:**
1. **Must be Outline Level 3 or deeper** (skips project/phase levels)
2. **Must have Milestone flag = 1** OR **Duration = 0**
3. **Summary tasks are skipped** (only leaf tasks)
4. **Regular tasks are ignored** (not shown in reporter)

### ✅ No Configuration Required
Your existing MS Project file works as-is:
- No custom fields needed
- No restructuring required
- Standard MS Project milestones (0 duration) are automatically detected
- Uses built-in MS Project milestone flag

### ✅ Auto-Generation Features
- **Project Code**: Auto-generated from project name if not set
- **Status**: Defaults to "IN_PROGRESS" if not specified
- **Milestone Status**: Auto-detected from % Complete:
  - 0% = NOT_STARTED
  - 1-99% = IN_PROGRESS
  - 100% = COMPLETED

## What You Need to Do

### Before First Upload:
1. **Mark milestones** in MS Project (Duration = 0) ← You probably already do this!
2. **Export to XML** (File → Save As → XML Format)
3. **Upload to Systems³** (📤 Upload XML page)

### Weekly Updates:
1. Update % Complete on milestones
2. Export to XML
3. Upload → System detects changes automatically
4. Add reasons for date changes
5. Save

## File Structure Expected

```
Your MS Project File (exported to XML)
├── Level 1: Project Summary Tasks (becomes Projects in Systems³)
├── Level 2: Phase groupings (optional, ignored)
└── Level 3+: Milestones (Duration=0 or Milestone flag set)
    └── Regular tasks (ignored - not shown in Systems³)
```

## What Gets Imported

### From Each Project:
- Project Name (from summary task)
- Start Date
- Target Completion Date
- Completion %
- Status

### From Each Milestone:
- Milestone Name
- Target Date
- Completion %
- Status (auto-detected)
- Actual Completion Date (if 100%)
- Notes

## What's Ignored

- ❌ Regular tasks (see them in MS Project)
- ❌ Phase groupings (Level 2)
- ❌ Resources
- ❌ Baselines (future feature)
- ❌ Dependencies (future feature)

## Multiple Projects in One File

If your MS Project file has multiple Level 1 summary tasks (multiple projects), the current version will:
- Use the project-level metadata for ALL milestones
- You may want to export each project separately

**Recommendation for multi-project files:**
- Export each project individually, OR
- Upload the combined file (all milestones will be under one project)
- Future enhancement: Auto-detect multiple projects from Level 1 tasks

## Next Steps for You

1. **Review your MS Project file**:
   - Confirm milestones are marked (0 duration)
   - Check outline levels (milestones should be Level 3+)

2. **Export a test XML**:
   - File → Save As → XML Format

3. **Upload and test**:
   - Use the 📤 Upload XML page
   - Review what gets detected

4. **Provide feedback**:
   - What milestones are missing?
   - What's being detected that shouldn't be?
   - Any structure issues?

## Future Enhancements (Based on Your Feedback)

- [ ] Multi-project detection (multiple Level 1 tasks)
- [ ] Baseline comparison (show baseline vs current)
- [ ] Dependency tracking
- [ ] Resource assignments
- [ ] Cost tracking
- [ ] Configurable outline level for milestones
