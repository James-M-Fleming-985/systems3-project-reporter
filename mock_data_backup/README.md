## Testing Coverage

This mock data is designed to test all report features:

1. **Gantt Charts**: Timeline visualization across multiple months
2. **Milestone Tracking Quadrants**:
   - Past Complete: 9 milestones (from September and earlier)
   - Current In Progress: 4 milestones (October)
   - Future Upcoming: 10 milestones (November onwards)
   - Ensures all quadrants are populated

3. **Risk Aggregation**:
   - HIGH severity: 3 risks across projects
   - MEDIUM severity: 4 risks across projects
   - LOW severity: 3 risks across projects
   - Tests color-coding and prioritization

4. **Change Management**:
   - 5 total schedule changes logged
   - Mix of delays and accelerations
   - Tests impact tracking and approval workflows
