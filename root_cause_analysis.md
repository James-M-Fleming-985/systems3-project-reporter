# Root Cause Analysis: Why We're Going in Circles

## Problems Encountered (In Order)

1. **Method Name Mismatches** (ORIGINAL ISSUE)
   - feature_integration.py calling methods that don't exist in layers
   - Example: Calling `prepare_data()` when layer has `process_tasks()`
   - ROOT CAUSE: Two-pass AI generation with no coordination

2. **Config Field Mismatches** 
   - settings.yaml using field names that don't match FeatureConfig dataclasses
   - Example: `supported_formats` vs `schema_path`
   - ROOT CAUSE: Same as #1 - no coordination between passes

3. **Markdown Code Fences in Python Files**
   - AI wrapping Python code in ```python ... ```
   - ROOT CAUSE: AI treating output as markdown instead of raw Python
   - This is NEW - didn't happen in original generation

4. **Missing Type Imports**
   - `Tuple` used but not imported
   - ROOT CAUSE: AI generating incomplete imports

5. **ResponseStatus API Misuse**
   - Calling `.is_success()` method on enum that doesn't have it
   - ROOT CAUSE: AI inventing APIs instead of using actual enum comparison

6. **Class Name Inconsistencies**
   - `MilestoneTracker` vs `FeatureOrchestrator`
   - ROOT CAUSE: No enforcement of naming conventions

7. **Config Initialization Issues**
   - Settings missing required fields after regeneration
   - ROOT CAUSE: Each system regeneration loses previous config state

## The Core Problem

**STATELESS REGENERATION**: Each time we regenerate:
- The AI has NO MEMORY of previous generations
- No continuity between system integration and features
- No validation that generated code matches actual APIs

## Why Build Script Enhancements Aren't Enough

Our fixes (method extraction, config field extraction) help with:
✅ Method signatures available at generation time
✅ Config field names available at generation time

But they DON'T fix:
❌ Code quality issues (markdown wrapping)
❌ API invention (calling non-existent methods)
❌ Import completeness
❌ State consistency across regenerations

## The Real Solution

We need **VALIDATION + ITERATION**:

1. Generate code
2. **PARSE** it (check syntax)
3. **IMPORT** it (check runtime errors)
4. **INSPECT** it (verify APIs match)
5. If errors → **REGENERATE with error feedback**

Current flow: Generate → Hope it works
Needed flow: Generate → Validate → Fix → Repeat until valid

## Immediate Issue

We've regenerated features 3-4 times now:
- Each time introduces NEW bugs
- Settings.yaml keeps getting overwritten with incomplete data
- No accumulation of fixes - each regen starts from scratch

The system integration (generate_report.py, settings.yaml) should be:
- Generated ONCE with all FeatureConfig fields
- NEVER regenerated (or backed up before regen)
- Manually maintained thereafter
